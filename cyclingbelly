To start truing the wheel, you will need to identify any lateral or radial deviations. You can do this by spinning the wheel and looking for any areas where the rim is not touching the truing stand evenly. Once you have identified any deviations, you can start adjusting the spoke nipples to correct them.

The amount of spoke tension that you need to adjust will depend on the severity of the deviation. For small deviations, you may only need to turn the spoke nipple a few degrees. For larger deviations, you may need to turn the spoke nipple a few full turns.

It is important to be careful when truing a bicycle wheel, as too much spoke tension can damage the wheel. If you are not sure how [to cycling belly fat](http://bicycle2sports.com/), it is best to take it to a professional bike mechanic.
